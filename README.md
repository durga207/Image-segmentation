# Image-segmentation
This project focuses on using graph cuts to divide an image into background and foreground segments. The framework consists of two parts. First, a network flow graph is built based on the input image. Then a max-flow algorithm is run on the graph in order to find the min-cut, which produces the optimal segmentation.
For more details refer the report.
